# EFR32MG12 I2C Drivers

## Overview
This project makes use of the EFR32MG12's I2C peripheral to interact with the Silicon Labs Thunderboard Sense 2's on-board Si1133 light sensor.

## Functionality
These drivers enable read and write capabilities via I2C. This project only interacts with the Si1133 light sensor, but the drivers support two concurrent I2C state machines (one per I2C peripheral).

## Documentation
Documentation for this project may be found in [documentation.pdf](docs/documentation.pdf).
